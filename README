# SHORT PYTHON GAMES

Short games and projects I made to learn and practice python. 

## 2048
I started by following a tutorial but in the end I programmed it without following the tutorial step by step. 

## Wyrdle
A copy of the wordle game by Josh Wardle.
This game I made by following a tutorial step by step:
https://realpython.com/python-wordle-clone/
To play the game:
-  cd .\wordle_clone\ (Open 'wordle_clone' folder)
- (Activate virtual environment):
	python -m venv venv
	venv\Scripts\Activate
- python -m pip install rich (install rich)
- .\wyrdle.py (run the program and play!)
